# Latent-space Planning and Disentangled Control in MiniGrid


This project involves first training a reward-free JEPA planning model based on Planning with Latent Dynamics Model (PLDM) paper (Sobal et al, 2025) using BFS optimal + noisy trajectories from the MiniGrid DoorKey 5×5 environment and analyzing its learned latent dynamics. Building on this baseline, I then introduce a disentangled PLDM variant to examine how separating latent factors influences representation quality and downstream planning performance.
